# Color Cycle Solver using Prolog

## Introduction
This Prolog program aims to solve the color cycle puzzle. Given a board consisting of cells with colors (Red, Yellow, or Blue), the program searches for cycles of at least 4 cells with the same color that are adjacent to each other.

### Requirements
Prolog interpreter (e.g., SWI-Prolog)

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-cycle-solver.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd prolog-color-cycles-detection```
3. Run the Prolog program:
```swipl color-detection.pl```
4. The program will output either a color cycle found or a message indicating that no cycles exist.
